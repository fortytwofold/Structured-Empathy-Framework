# Templates

This section includes templates that can be used for activities, illustrating discussions, or personal development. This will grow in time, and is a great oppourtunity for people to provide examples and samples from their own work in this domain.

The templates are a mixture of those that form part of the Structured Empathy Framework content itself, and links to external templates from other organisations and sources.
